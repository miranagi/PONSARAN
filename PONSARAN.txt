     I would like to sincerely thank my ICT teacher, Mr. Kinji Guitirrez, my parents and my classmates for helping 
and supporting me throughout this quarter as I wouldn't be able to pass this subject without them.

     This quarter taught me more about using HTML and CSS codes to format and modify text in webpages. I also 
learned more about the complex yet somewhat simple ways of web programming. 

Of course, there can't be learning without any challenges, which for me were the number of terms and concepts 
I had to memorize for the quizzes and exams as well as putting said  concepts into use through our performance 
tasks involving web programming. I worked to familliarize myself with the information needed to be able to do 
and practice using them in coding, and was able to make it through eventually. The lessons about HTML and 
CSS will be very helpful to be especially if I decide to become a web programmer in the future.
(which is on my career list as of right now). And speaking of lessons, the one about formatting texts was the most 
valuable to me as it introduced me to new tags and attributes that I can use to modify, express and emphasize 
my text in a lot of ways, and to just make my webpages look a lot more stylish like what I've always wanted to do 
ever since HTML was first introduced to us.

     Although none of the issues I have faced significantly affect my grades this quarter, I can still improve 
the rate of which I memorize concepts and the ability to remember them as I use them to code my websites. 
Learning more about web programmming has helped my knowledge on the subject grow like never before. I 
realized more on just how complicated making websites can get, and at the same time how wonderful the 
outputs of the hard work of programmers can be. HTML and CSS have fascinated me and have thus fueled my 
aspirations to potentially become a programmer in the future. Not just to create websites but to also 
create games and even new programs and technology.

     To neatly tie everything up in a bow I can safely say that I have enjoyed this quarter of lessons in ICT. 
It has helped me grow and has improved my skills and knowledge when it comes to how websites work and how 
to program them. I hope to be able to do better next quarter and I can't wait for the lessons that we will learn 
about there. Admittedly I just really love the concept of coding, and TLE/ICT as a subject in general :)
