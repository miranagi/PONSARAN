The first day of Grade 9.

I was nervous, which I guess is a normal thing, but at the same time excited to get to know my new classmates and teachers 
and make new memories this school year. When I first entered the classroom that morning, it was empty and quiet, but the silence
soon shifted to joyful chatter as more of my classmates filled the vacant seats. 
A while later, Ms. Dancal, our advisor, entered the room and greeted us, thus beginning the long hours of sitting and 
listening to class orientations. Note that I only stated 'long', not 'boring'. And I can thank all the friendly subject
teachers I met as well as my enthusiastic classmates making the rest of the school day much more tolerable and engaging, despite
waking up before the crack of dawn a few hours ago. 
The day ended before I knew it, and as I reflected on its events I knew I'd be just fine.

New life, new home. I could get used to this, actually.
